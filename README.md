# yelp-data-analysis
In this Python-based data analysis project, I explored a dataset from Yelp! to test several hypotheses related to restaurant characteristics and their impact on ratings and operational status. The project focused on the following hypotheses:

- Restaurants that are open have better ratings than those that are not.
- Restaurants that deliver food have worse ratings.
- Restaurants that allow smoking are less likely to be open.

To address these hypotheses, I utilized a range of data science skills:

- Data Preparation and Cleaning: The project began with extensive data preparation and cleaning to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis. This included handling missing values, isolating desired data values, and encoding categorical variables.
- Statistical Models: I employed statistical models to test the hypotheses. This included calculating average ratings and conducting hypothesis tests such as the two-sample t-tests and chi-square test of independence to determine the relationships between restaurant features and their ratings or operational status.
- Libraries Used: The analysis utilized Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and scipy for performing statistical tests.
- Coding Best Practices: The code was written following best practices, including clear documentation, modular code design, and thorough testing to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results.

This project demonstrated my ability to apply data science techniques, including data analysis, statistical modeling, and hypothesis testing, to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.
